[0:00:03] spk_0: certain people on the

[0:00:04] spk_1: platform that you look at and the way that they treat their business and the way that maybe their pioneering what it means to be a creator. Are their creators like that, that you're watching, you're taking notes from?

[0:00:12] spk_0: Yeah, I think Mr Beast is sort of the obvious answer right now. Just as far as business ventures, we've talked a lot about this, but just like how to focus a team on building something that you're like, that you're building, get everybody on the same page and building towards the same thing. So I think that that would be the obvious answer is like, how can you not respect? Like not only the the depth of of like the videos that he makes and how far he goes to make each video, but to see the process a little bit behind the scenes, I feel like even David debris a little bit of the same thing where you see him at an event and he'll have his camera and it will be this. I remember this pretty specifically saw him at the Cybertruck event and he was just kind of hanging out and the cybertruck goes on stage and it's just this crazy thing and I'm there to make an entire video about the cybertruck and I remember like watching his vlog like a couple days later whenever the next one was and there wasn't a single second of footage from that because it just wasn't good enough and like that to that, to me, that level of dedication to, you know that craft which is like collecting all the best moments was was inspiring to so I'll toss some love too, too Dah Brick and Mr Beast.
